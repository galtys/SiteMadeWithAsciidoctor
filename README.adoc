= Site Made With Asciidoctor
Demo of website produced using only Asciidoctor

Start with your content marked up as AsciiDoc. See text files in the directory. I am using a header and footer that is included on the index and page one AsciiDoc text file.

I'm using Asciidoctor 'smart links' to convert the file extension ".adoc" or ".txt" to ".html"

 <<page2.adoc#,Smart Link to page 2>>
 or
 <<page2.txt#,Smart Link to page 2>>

both renders as a link

 href="page2.html"

== To render the pages

At the command prompt

 > asciidoctor -a stylesheet=styles/maker.css  *.txt

If you'd like to use the colony stylesheet use

 > asciidoctor -a stylesheet=styles/colony.css  *.txt

== Push or FTP

Push your files back to your GitHub 'gh-pages' branch.

Or just FTP the .html files that were generated to your website.
